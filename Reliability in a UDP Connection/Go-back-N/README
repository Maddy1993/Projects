In the GO-Back_N protocol,
sender and receiver maintain a window size, which is greater than or equal to 1. In doing so, the sender can send N packets to the receiver and decrease the overhead which is 
involved in Stop-and-Wait protocol. When both the sender and receiver window sizes do not match, the connection between them is stopped.

Example: 
when sender and receiver window size = 3
In this scenario, the sender sends 3 packets before listening to an ackowledgment from the receiver. If there is any packet drop, either from the sender or receiver,
the sender sends the last acknowledged in-order packet to the receiver. At the same time, if there is any duplicate packet, receivers drops or avoids from adding the packet to
the file. If there is any packet drop from sender, the receiver only sends one ack notifying that it requires the packet after the last ack'ed in -order packet.

Testing:
Command:
	 make
Executing sender:
	./sender -p <port> -m <mode> -h <hostname> -f <filename>

port is the value to which the sender should the send the data.
mode is the window size
hostname is the address of the sender
filename is the name of the file to send

Executing receiver:
	./receiver -p <port> -h <hostname> -m <mode>

port is the value of the port on the machine to which the receiver should bind
hostname is the value of the address of the machine on which the receiver should be running
mode is the window size of the receiver
