Client-Server Model:
-------------------

The Stop-and-Wait and GO-BACK-N protocols depend on the window size of the sender and receiver.
In Stop-and-Wait, the sender and receiver have a window size of 1
and in GO-BACK-N, the sender window size can be specified by the user and receiver receives the packets based on the window size specified.

Stop-and-Wait:
-------

Testing Sender:
---------
1. Change directory to Stop-and-Wait
2. Change to sender
2. Connection to the server: 
        ./makeSender 1 <port> <host> <file_name>
3. When the file has been sent, end-of-file indicator will be displayed and the connection will be closed.


Testing Receiver:
---------
1. Change directory to Stop-and-Wait
2. Change to receiver
2. Connection to the server: 
        ./makeReceiver 1 <port> <host> 
3. When all the packets are successfully delivered, connection will be closed.


GO-BACK-N:
-------

Testing Sender:
---------
1. Change directory to Stop-and-Wait
2. Change to sender
2. Connection to the server: 
        ./makeSender N <port> <host> <file_name>
3. When the file has been sent, end-of-file indicator will be displayed and the connection will be closed.


Testing Receiver:
---------
1. Change directory to Stop-and-Wait
2. Change to receiver
2. Connection to the server: 
        ./makeReceiver N <port> <host> 
3. When all the packets are successfully delivered, connection will be closed.
