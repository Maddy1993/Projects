# Mohan Pothukuchi
  ### Candidate for Master of Science in Computer and Information Science at Northeastern University, Boston

My field of research and works include but are not limited to:
  * Understanding distributed Systems and generalizing a method to develop a versatile system which can integrate and scale when required.
  * Analyzing ways to build a search engine and understand why other permutations of algorithms fail to live up to the task. If there are any possibilities, that were ignored previously due to technical challenges, I aim to revisit and modify them, so that better results can be achieved in this growing information world.

Distributed Systems application developer with practical experience in developing distributed, scalable, efficient and multithreaded applications. An experienced Oracle Application Developer with a demonstrated history of working in the information technology and services industry. Skilled in C, Python, Go, Java, Oracle SQL, Microsoft Word, and C++. Strong engineering professional with a B.Tech focused in Computer Science and Engineering from GITAM University. 

*This GitHUB folder consists of works I have developed during the learning path and I strongly believe that these will shoawcase my strength and skills as a Programmer.*
